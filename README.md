# Python Virtual Environment and Packages (Challenge 2)
---

This challenge demonstrates how to download packages locally by creating a virtual environment. All packages downlaoded are located in a sub folder named 'env'. I created a simple program which takes in a max amount of numbers from the user then calculates the sum of all numbers inputted. The final sum is then divided by the total number of inputs (max amount). This then outputs the average. Colorama has been imported to add some style to the terminal's output.

### Activation
```
PS C:\Users\randy\Documents\GitHub\RA-Modules-Packages-Demo> env\scripts\activate
```

Notice that (env) is now visable in the terminal. This confirms the activation.
```
(env) PS C:\Users\randy\Documents\GitHub\RA-Modules-Packages-Demo>
```

### Colorama Installation
```
(env) PS C:\Users\randy\Documents\GitHub\RA-Modules-Packages-Demo> pip install colorama
```

## Challenge Requirements

#### First Task (MS VS Code Terminal Window or PowerShell):
   * You will create a virtual environment (notice that virtual environment or venv is a just a local folder that has to be created inside your main project folder) using any name you prefer.
   * After creating your virtual environment or venv, you will need to activate it.
   * Install the required package, for this challenge we can use the same package called “colorama”, but feel free to use another one.
   * Try to find the official page for this package.

#### Second Task (Your python code, applying colorama to your print message):
   * From colorama import ???
   * Use any color…
   * You can refer to my folder “Anmar-Modules-Packages-Demo” for more details
