# Python Virtual Environment and Packages (Challenge 2)
---

This challenge demonstrates how to download packages locally by creating a virtual environment. All packages downlaoded are located in a sub folder named 'venv'.

### Activation
```
PS C:\Users\randy\Documents\GitHub\RA-Modules-Packages-Demo> env\scripts\activate
```

Notice that (env) is now visable in the terminal. This confirms the activation.
```
(env) PS C:\Users\randy\Documents\GitHub\RA-Modules-Packages-Demo>
```

## Challenge Requirements

#### First Task (MS VS Code Terminal Window or PowerShell):
   * You will create a virtual environment (notice that virtual environment or venv is a just a local folder that has to be created inside your main project folder) using any name you prefer.
   * After creating your virtual environment or venv, you will need to activate it.
   * Install the required package, for this challenge we can use the same package called “colorama”, but feel free to use another one.
   * Try to find the official page for this package.

#### Second Task (Your python code, applying colorama to your print message):
   * From colorama import ???
   * Use any color…
   * You can refer to my folder “Anmar-Modules-Packages-Demo” for more details
